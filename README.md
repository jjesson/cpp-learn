How to learn C++

This is going to be a learning environment where I try and take things I learn and discover ways to use code/.
I will update this as I go through with programs, with how they work and what I am planning to do with the code


Program 1: Hello World.
  This is designed to teach me the extreme basics of how to set up a program
  
  
Prgram 2 : Odd Echo.
  This program takes in a set of inputs and then returns only the odd indexed codes
